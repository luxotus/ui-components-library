# UI Components Library
A collection of UI components that are commonly used by many websites. All components will have a button that opens a modal with the related code for creating it. Components use basic html, css and plain javascript instead of using a specific framework and/or library. When looking through the style sheets you will notice that their sass files but inside the related components file is plain css. Main reason for this is to bundle all css in the end and I prefer sass file/folder architecture. If you have any questions and/or suggestions let me know.
